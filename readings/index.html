<p class="header">JR CARPENTER, A HANDMADE WEB +</p>
<div class="content">
<p>“JR”I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement with the making of web pages and of web policies.
  The expectations and behaviors of the next billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves.
  The web got really big and complex and we now crave DIY close KNIT
  “My website”
  Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media
  Website can set people straight of what and who you are
  You don’t need to limit yourself with one website
  Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity
  Artists excel at creating worlds- creating everything—not only making things inside the world and also the surrounding world itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture.
  How could a website compliment your work
  It can be unfinished, host your process, your writings
  Knowledge became the architect
  Not a cloud, something more tangible that allows us to remember our responsibility
  The web can be used to make our mark and own our responsibility and close a divide
  “A rant about technology”
  Technology is the active human interface with the material world
